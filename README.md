# AI-project

The project of the AI class (Artificial Inteligence).

The goal of the project was to create solver for Takuzu puzzles using Search algorithms.

The project was written in Python and explored concepts like Informed and Uninformed Search, graph exploration (DFS, BFS, etc.) and Heuristics.

# How to run
To run the code, do `python3 takuzu.py < *input_board*`, passing a initial board as input.  
The script will solve the board.  
Example boards can be found in the `testes-takuzu` folder.
